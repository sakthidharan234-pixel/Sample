# Sample
A sample project to test out
	•	IoT = lots of devices (sensors, machines, smart objects) connected to the internet; Edge computing = processing data close to where it originates (reducing latency).  ￼
	•	IoB is a newer term: analysing behaviour via networks of devices, data, interactions.  ￼
	•	Why it matters: In your convenience store or tea‐shop, IoT + edge could mean smart inventory sensors, automated re-stock alerts, customer-behaviour insights (peak times, popular products) — giving you an operational edge.
	•	Consider: Implementation cost, power/internet infrastructure in Coimbatore, staff training, data privacy aspects.
